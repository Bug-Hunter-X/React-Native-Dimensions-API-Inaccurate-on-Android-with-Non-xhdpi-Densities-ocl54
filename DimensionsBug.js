This bug occurs when using the `Dimensions` API in React Native to get screen dimensions, especially on Android.  The issue arises when the app is run on an Android device with a screen density other than xhdpi. In these cases, the `width` and `height` values returned by `Dimensions.get('window')` are incorrect, usually smaller than the actual screen dimensions. This leads to layout problems where UI elements are displayed incorrectly or cut off.
